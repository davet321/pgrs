You've had a hard day, so join us in the pub to relax with a drink and some food at the end of the day.
Even if you haven't had a hard day, join us anyway.

This week we'll be in <span class="highlight">[Bacchus](http://www.bacchusglasgow.co.uk)</span> on the edge of the Merchant City.
Well-rated for its food, it also offers a wide selection of beers and cocktails.
See you all there!
