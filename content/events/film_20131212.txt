Pick your favourite Christmas movie and join us for the last PGRS Film Night this year.

You'll find us at The Lounge on Level 5 in the Union.
To celebrate Christmas and the end of the semester, we'll be organising free pizza for everyone.
Come from 6:30ish if you want to order pizza or half 7 for the movie.

Let us know if you're coming and vote to pick the film we'll be showing on the <span class="highlight">[Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1413577215544423/)</span>.
