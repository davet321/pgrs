Join us for our monthly film night, in the Lounge on Level 5 of the Union (not the Postgraduate Lounge!).
This month we'll be showing The Angels' Share, a comedy-drama film directed by Ken Loach.
Come from 6.30ish if you want to order pizza or half 7 for the movie.
Let us know on <span class="highlight">[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/533150860096401/?ref=2)</span> if you're coming.
