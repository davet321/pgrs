'And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted- nevermore!'
[Edgar Allan Poe - The Raven]

Are you in the mood to be scared out of your wits?
PGRS presents a film night not suitable for the weak-hearted and scaredy-pants. Put on your best Halloween dress and you might even win a small prize.

You'll find us at The Lounge in the Union. Those of you who are paying attention will realise that the lift doesn't stop at 5 and the stairs even jump from L4 to L6...
This is your mantra from now on -- take the lift to six and the stairs down to 5!

Come from 6.30ish if you want to order pizza or half 7 for the movie.
Let us know if you're coming and make suggestions for the film on our <span class="highlight">[Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/607363235973334/)</span>.
