Join us for our monthly film night, in the Lounge on Level 5 of the Union (not the Postgraduate Lounge!).
This month the theme is 'The Movies of Wes Anderson'.
Come from 7ish if you want to order pizza beforehand or half 8 for the movie.
Let us know if you're coming and vote to pick the film we'll be showing on the <span class="highlight">[Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/182688285256486/)</span>.
