Join us for a trip to the Christmas market for some mulled wine, food and sweets.

We'll be meeting at the giant safety pin in Rottenrow Gardens to walk down as a group at about 5:15 pm.
If you want to come later just head down yourself and keep an eye out for us there.

Let us know if you're coming on the <span class="highlight">[Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/431738676927910/)</span>.
