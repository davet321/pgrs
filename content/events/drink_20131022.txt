You've had a hard day, so join us in the pub to relax with a drink and some food at the end of the day.
Even if you haven't had a hard day, join us anyway.

This week we'll be in <span class="highlight">[Pivo Pivo](http://www.pivopivo.com)</span>, which boasts a wide range of beers (as if the name didn't give that away) from all around the world.
Conveniently located near Central Station, it also now hosts food from Smoak, purveyors of some of Glasgow's best burgers and BBQ food.
