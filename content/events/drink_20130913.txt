With over 160 beers from around Scotland, plus more from England & across Europe, Paisley Beer Festival is Scotland's biggest, and PGRS will be making the short trip through to experience it.
Come join us and celebrate the end of another week.

We'll meet at the swimming pool entrance of the Royal College just after 5 and head down to Central Station together, but if you want to make your own way there later (or earlier!) that's fine too.
The train takes 10-15 minutes to Paisley Gilmour St and there's usually about 8 an hour.
The Town Hall's just a short walk from the station.

Entry's &pound;5 (&pound;3 if you're a CAMRA member), which usually gets you a souvenir pint glass and programme.
More info's at <span class="highlight">[the website](http://www.paisleybeerfestival.org.uk/)</span> (although the beer list's not out yet).
