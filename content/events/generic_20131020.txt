Come explore some of Glasgow's slightly less high-profile museums with PGRS.

First up is the oldest house in Glasgow, <span class="highlight">[Provand's Lordship](http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/provands-lordship/Pages/default.aspx)</span>.
This was built in 1471 and is one of only four medieval buildings in Glasgow.
We'll meet outside the entrance at 1pm.

After we've explored that, we'll head over to <span class="highlight">[St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art](http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/st-mungos/Pages/default.aspx)</span>, which has displays and artefacts for all the world's major religions and also tells the story of religion in the west of Scotland.

Let us know if you're coming on our <span class="highlight">[Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/220571698109751)</span>.
