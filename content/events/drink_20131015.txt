You've had a hard day, so join us in the pub to relax with a drink and some food at the end of the day.
Even if you haven't had a hard day, join us anyway.

This week we'll be in <span class="highlight">[The Drum and Monkey](http://www.nicholsonspubs.co.uk/thedrumandmonkeystvincentstreetglasgow/)</span>, a traditional style pub offering a range of real ales and pub food, alongside a variety of other drinks.
