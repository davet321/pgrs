You can't spend your whole PhD locked in your lab.
Luckily, PGRS are here to provide you with plenty of opportunities to get out and about:

## One-off events

Throughout the year we put on plenty of one-off and special events.
Charity races, cocktail classes, rugby tournaments and the annual Postgraduate Festival are just a few of the events we've taken part in over the past year.
We're always looking to put on more, so if you've got any ideas (or want to organise something yourself), just let us know, and we can help get things rolling.
Keep an eye on the list below, or <span class="highlight">[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/PGRSstrath)</span> and <span class="highlight">[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/PGRSstrath)</span> to keep up with what we've got planned.

## Regular events

For those of you that can't make one off events you see advertised, fear no more because we have a number of different regular events!
If sports are your thing then we have a pre booked badminton court every Monday from 5--6pm where you can come and enjoy a relaxed (or competitive) game of badminton and get to meet new people in the process.

We also hold regular film nights which are usually shown in the student union and these have proven to be one of our most popular events.
The theme and subsequent films being shown on the night is usually chosen by a poll on our Facebook page a week or so in advance.
If you have a particular interest to watch a film then please let us know and we can arrange this if the theme and/or film prove to be popular then it will be shown!

Tuesday nights are our pub social nights and the pub venue changes from week to week.
We always try to bring you the best deals on food and drinks and will always let members know in advance where to find us!

Halfway through the week we like to mark the occasion with a bit of a long lunch.
Wednesdays 12--2pm we'll be in the Postgraduate Room on the 6th floor of the Union.
